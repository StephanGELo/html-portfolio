<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I consider myself a passionate problem solver. I love diving into complex situations, unraveling the key problems statements, and then identifying the simplest code to nail the issues. For me, full stack programming is exactly this - a way of connecting the dots with the relevant tools & technologies for optimal performance. 
  When I'm not coding, I'm on the field playing soccer ... or finding the next pick up soccer game.
